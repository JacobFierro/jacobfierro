		<p>At Weill Cornell the physician profiles are on a closed system, there was no way to search relevant doctors on any of the dozens of individual patient care sites... until now. This was probably the best project I had at WCMC and I'm extremely proud of the outcome.</p>
		<p>This project started as a blank slate requirement from the Department of Surgery: "We need to be able to search for and feature our surgeons on our own site." I began considering the many modes of search a user may have and did extensive work cratering to the correct user image of a complex search system.</p>
		<p>Development was another challenge. jQuery proved up to the task of some very heavy DOM manipulation (of course) and as WCMC is a non-dynamic environment all data manipulation had to be done client side in JS. Testing revealed my system could handle filtering and highlighting thousands of records in just milliseconds.</p>
		<p>UPDATE: Unfortunately, it appears that this project has languished in my absence. Here's a link to a <a href="http://jacobfierro.com/fas">dev version</a>.</p>
